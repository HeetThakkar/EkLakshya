       Good afternoon to one and all present here,
       I am Heet Thakkar, completed my bachelors in computer engineering. As i was keen on making my career in software development since childhood, I opted to do diploma in computer engineering. I believe onces development must be holistic I also play cricket for which i have got many certificate and trophies.
       Weakness:
       Waking up early.
       Can't say no 
       I am less patient
       Strength:
       I get mixed up with everyone.
       Respect for elders. 
       Like accepting challenges
       I always try to overcome my weakness.
